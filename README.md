# instructor-and-TA-notices

This repository is my attempt to collect all my many emails and documents I've been sending to rstudio::conf(2020) instructors and TAs in one place so that they don't have to search their email inboxes to find these documents.

Most of this information was originally sent in emails or Google docs, but it seemed appropriate to have one repository for this information so that it's available for reference when we do rstudio::conf(2021).

I apologize that some materials are in proprietary formats, but for things like spreadsheets and rich text docs, I wanted folks to be able to have formats that could be directly uploaded to Google Docs.
